# eye-disease-detection
CNN machine learning model to classify eye diseases including caracts, glacouma, cross eye, and other vision impairments with class label from 0-4. 
Received accuracy of 85 percent on training data
The second model was completed on a different dataset that was more processed 
this dataset can be found on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gunavenkatdoddi/eye-diseases-classification
I also used a different preprocessing method for the second one: Instead of generators I split into normal X train, and Y train
